Space defenders is a game inspired by the arcade game Galaga and The Binding of Isaac. 
Fight enemy ships and defend your home base (planet). Try and make it through as many rounds
as you can before you are invaded. After each round you may visit the shop and buy items 
and powerups to help you defeat the enemies. Enemies also have a 1% chance of spawning a 
"consumable" upon death which can then be used during the game to give you temporary powerups.
like instant health, freeze, and nuke. You can purchase "reusables" in the shop which can be
activated by pressing q, w, or e.
